        "The Virtual Labs project, which was established in 2009, represents a significant initiative of the Ministry of Education, Government of India. This innovative program poised to drive a meaningful change in education and research in India, provides a platform for interactive learning through experiments.",
        "Among the key groups targeted are students and faculty members of science and engineering colleges, who may lack access to high-quality laboratory facilities and equipment. Additionally, high school students are encouraged to explore their curiosity through the program, potentially inspiring them to pursue further studies in these fields.",
        "The Virtual Labs project also seeks to create a network of researchers across different institutes, who can collaborate and share resources, thereby promoting the exchange of knowledge and ideas. Importantly, the project's content and teaching resources are designed to benefit engineering colleges and other institutions, making it a highly inclusive and impactful initiative."
    ],
    "objectives": [
        "To provide remote-access to simulation-based Labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering.",
        "To enthuse students to conduct experiments by arousing their curiosity. This would help them in learning basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation.",
        "To provide a complete Learning Management System around the Virtual Labs where the students/ teachers can avail the various tools for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation."
    ],
    "philosophy": {
        "decsription": "Good lab facilities and updated lab experiments are critical for any engineering college. Paucity of lab facilities often make it difficult to conduct experiments. Also, good teachers are always a scarce resource. The Virtual Labs project addresses this issue of lack of good lab facilities, as well as trained teachers, by providing remote-access to simulation-based Labs in various disciplines of science and engineering. Yet another objective is to arouse the curiosity of the students and permit them to learn at their own pace. This student-centric approach facilitates the absorption of basic and advanced concepts through simulation-based experimentation. Internet-based experimentation further permits use of additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation. Specifically, the Virtual Labs project addresses the following:",
        "points": [
            "Access to online labs to those engineering colleges that lack these lab facilities",
            "Access to online labs as a complementary facility to those colleges that already have labs",
            "Training and skill-set augmentation through workshops and on-site/ online training"

        "conclusion": "Virtual labs are any place, any pace, any-time, any-type labs. It is a paradigm shift in student-centric, online education."

Pretest and post-test feature provided make the self-assessment part easy for the students. This platform provides a wide range of experiments covering almost all kind of domain and it is very beneficial for the students. As a Nodal Coordinator of Virtual Lab for Chameli Devi Group of Institution, I am very much satisfied with virtual lab facility as it helps the students to engage more with self-learning path.",
