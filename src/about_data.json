This innovative program, poised to drive a meaningful change in education and research in India, provides a platform for interactive learning through experiments.\n\nAmong the key groups targeted are students and faculty members of science and engineering colleges, who may lack access to high-quality laboratory facilities and equipment. Additionally, high school students are encouraged to explore their curiosity through the program, potentially inspiring them to pursue further studies in these fields.\n\nThe Virtual Labs project also seeks to create a network of researchers across different institutes, who can collaborate and share resources, thereby promoting the exchange of knowledge and ideas. Importantly, the project's content and teaching resources are designed to benefit engineering colleges and other institutions, making it a highly inclusive and impactful initiative.\n"
